This project aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the Observation Unit (OU) of Montanaro Hospital, where long patient stays and high inpatient transition rates were prevalent. By leveraging predictive analytics, we developed a model that significantly refined the OU's exclusion criteria, using patient demographics, preliminary diagnoses, and clinical values. The refined model effectively reduced patient stay durations, enhanced unit throughput, and improved hospital capacity - critical during peak seasons like flu outbreaks. This initiative not only streamlined patient flow but also augmented financial outcomes by reducing losses associated with patients leaving without being seen.
